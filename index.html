    <h2>What is Combinatorics?</h2>
    <p>Combinatorics is the study of counting, arrangements, and combinations. It explores how elements can be grouped based on the availability of those elements and how they can be distributed based on particular constraints.  </p>
    <p> The main concepts include permutations which involves the ordering of elements and combinations which is the selection of elements without regard to order.</p>
    <p>When it comes to resource distribution in various parts of the world, there is an issue of inequality based on bias, nepotism and other forms of injustice. This can be resolved through the equal distribution of resources in both rural and urban areas, and this can be done through combination</p>
    <p>In countries like Ghana, urban areas, especially Accra (the capital), are the economic hubs of Ghana, receiving the majority of investments, services, and opportunities. Rural areas often face higher poverty rates and lower access to infrastructure like roads, health facilities, and educational institutions.
    <p>This affects their quality of life, education, health and even food resources.</p>
    <p>This can be resolved by creating an easy way of ensuring that each area receives a good amount of resources without any bias</p>
    <p>An example of finding ways to distribute resources based on the needs of each sector can be found below:</p>

    <h2>Understanding Graph Theory</h2>
    <p>Graph theory explores relationships using nodes and edges(paths between them). It helps model systems like transportation, pollution, and resource flow.</p>
    <p>The distribution of reources can also be illustrated through graphs(bipartite graphs)</p>
    <p>A bipartite graph is a special kind of graph where the set of nodes can be divided into two distinct groups, and edges only connect nodes from different groups, never within the same group.</p>
    <p>In the context of resource distribution, the two groups would be:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Group 1: Resources — Water, Food, Medicine, etc</li>
      <li> Group 2: Regions — Region A, Region B, Region C</li>
    </ul>
